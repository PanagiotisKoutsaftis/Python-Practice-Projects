# PythonPractice
In this repository you can find all the mini projects I completed while learning python.
I used Deitel's book to learn (appart from online lectures and tutorials) so here you will also find most of the book's unsolved
exercises (which I solved). Some of them are not in the form of a .py file but as a notebook file. You can open them using jupyter 
notebooks
The title of the book is "Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science" from Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel
